# Melanoma_Skin_Cancer
To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

* [Conclusions](#conclusions)

## Technologies Used
- pandas - version 2.2.0
- seaborn - version 0.13.2
- numpy - version 1.26.3
- matplotlib - version 3.8.2
- Tensorflow - 2.18.0

## Conclusions
- The ultimate model showcases well-balanced performance, displaying no signs of underfitting or overfitting.
- The implementation of class rebalancing has notably enhanced the model's performance across both training and validation datasets.
- Following 37 epochs, the final model attains an accuracy of 84% on the training set and approximately 79% on the validation set.
- The narrow divergence between training and validation accuracies underscores the robust generalization capability of the final CNN model.
- The addition of batch normalization failed to enhance both training and validation accuracy.
